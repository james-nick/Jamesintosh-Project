An "operating system" in very simple code which is made in notepad. Very small size as well as very little skill :(

Official project name:
FakeMac Interface Project
Welcome to the FakeMac Interface project! This project aims to simulate a macOS-like desktop environment using web technologies, specifically HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to create a functional and interactive interface that mimics the feel and look of macOS, with features like a dynamic wallpaper, floating windows, a Menu Bar, and a Dock.

Features
Mac-like Menu Bar: A top bar with the Mac logo, app menus, system icons, and a shutdown button.

Floating Windows: Includes a browser and Notepad window that mimic macOS-style behavior, complete with minimize, maximize, and close buttons.

Finder Sidebar: A sidebar that resembles macOS Finder for quick file access.

Dock: A floating Dock at the bottom of the screen with interactive app icons.

Blue Wallpaper: A customizable background that mimics macOS’ high-resolution wallpapers.

Requirements
A computer lol.

Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (optional but helpful if you want to contribute!)
